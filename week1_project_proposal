E.D.A week 1 , project proposal

Questions:

1) My project is about identifying the busiest locations in NYC:
	a) on different days (i.e. weekdays and weekends) 
	b) in different time slots of the day (i.e. morning rush hour, launch break time, evening rush hour)
	
2) My client is New York Food Truck Association(https://nyfta.org/). They are giving supporting services to those who want to get a license and operate a food truck within NYC limits. Since the covid, most people started to work from homes and old favorable locations are not that great anymore. So they are looking for a data scientist to figure out the post-covid patterns in the city for the new favorable locations.

Data Description:

1) I will be using NYC turnstile dataset:
http://web.mta.info/developers/turnstile.html

2) a single line of the data looks like below:

C\A,UNIT,SCP,STATION,LINENAME,DIVISION,DATE,TIME,DESC,ENTRIES,EXITS                                                               
A002,R051,02-00-00,59 ST,NQR456W,BMT,03/26/2022,00:00:00,REGULAR,0007697197,0002683684

includes enter/exit data for every station in NYC with 4-h dite durations (8-12 , 12-4, 4-8 etc)

3) I am intereted in station name, data, time , entires and exits

Tools:

1) I will be using using SQL to create desired databases and use pandas to clear data and do the neccessery adjustments and visualize my results using matplotlib and seaborn.

Potential improvements along the way:
1) Does seasons effect the outcome; due to tourist population etc, how does those optimal locations/days/times behave? Is there any different pattern of behaviours in different seasons

2) If I can establish a baseline for before covid numbers, I can compare them to the post covid values

3) HARD ONE: try overlaying a dataset of operating restaurants by zip code. So I can optimize the locations according to the competition with diners around the stations.
